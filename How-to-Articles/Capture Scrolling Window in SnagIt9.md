# Capture Scrolling Window in SnagIt 9
What if you're told to work on a software application that you have never worked before, and the only source of help available is the User Manual. Using the user manual, you can get started but what if the manual does not contain screen captures. In this case it becomes little difficult to understand and follow the steps mentioned in the manual. Documents that include screen captures are much easier to understand, and help you to get familiarized with the layout of the software application.

Today, many image-capturing tools are available in the market that help you to capture a desktop, window, region very easily. However, some of these tools have certain restrictions when it comes to capturing a scrolling window i.e. a multi page document or a web page that exceeds the window size. In this case, you have to capture a scrolling window one page at a time and then combine the multiple screen captures. This process is very time consuming and inaccurate.

This restriction is overcome by SnagItâ€™s Scrolling Window feature, using which you can capture a scrolling document in a single click.

### To capture a scrolling window:
1. Open the document or the web page that you want to capture.  
> [!NOTE] You need to first open the document because when you click the Capture button and if multiple documents are open then you can directly move to the required document or web page using ALT+TAB.
2. For Windows machine, click the Start button, and then point to All Programs. Point to SnagIt9, and then click SnagIt9. The SnagIt9 window displays as shown in Figure 1.
