# Style Guide
The rules set out in this Style Guide are designed to bring consistency to an organisation's technical documentation. These rules will help the documents to have a common voice and will reduce the number of grammatical and typographical errors, and proper grammar and punctuation will help to maintain credibility.  
Section Two of the guide contains a short pre-publication checklist that you should refer to for a quick check before sending a document out to review or to customers.
## Acronyms and Initialisations
Only use acronyms and initialisations if the term is used twice or more within the document or if the abbreviation is more common that the full name, like USA. Spell out the term, in full, the first time it is used and follow it with its abbreviation in brackets. From then on use the abbreviation.  
If the first appearance is in a title or heading, spell the term in full. Add the abbreviation when it first appears within the body of the document.  
Although acronyms or initialisations are usually in upper case, the full term is not necessarily written in title case.
You only need to spell out an acronym or initialisation if it is helpful to the reader. For example, you would only write “DVD” as it is well known and understood and has only one common meaning.  
Most abbreviations are the same for singular and plural. To make them plural add an “s”, do not use an apostrophe.
>[!NOTE]
>An acronym is pronounced as a word, like ASCII or NATO. An initialisation is not, like CD or BBC.
### EG, IE and Etc
Do not use e.g., i.e. and etc. Replace them with proper text such as: “for example“; “that is“; “such as“; “and so on“.
Abbreviations like these are out of place in technical documentation and are frequently used incorrectly with i.e. and e.g. being confused.
Etcetera is imprecise and lazy: give examples rather than assume the reader knows what you are thinking.
## Ampersands
Do not use “&” as a substitute for “and”, except where it is generally used, such as in a name, like Fortnum & Mason.
## Bullets and Lists
Use lists to chunk related information to make it easier for the reader to scan. Choose the type of list according to the information it contains. Create either an:
* ordered list (using numbers) to present information such as tasks or workflows in the sequence in which they must be read, understood or executed. Ordered lists should also be used if you are writing long sentences or paragraphs, or more than six bullets
* unordered list (bulleted, like this one) to present non-sequential, related information such as a series of options or choices.
Keep bullets short and to a minimum. Bullets and lists should be preceded by an introductory phrase or sentence ending with a colon.
If the bullet point is a complete sentence, start with a capital and end with a full stop. If you are just listing items, do not use any punctuation at the end of each bullet except the final one, which needs a full stop.
Where the bullets continue as part of the introductory sentence, start the bullets with lower case and do not use any punctuation to end them except for the final one, which requires a full stop.
For example, if the bulleted text is a continuation of the introductory sentence then:
* begin the list using lower case
* do not punctuate the first and middle bullets
* use a full stop at the end of the final bullet.
If possible avoid nested bullets, that is bullets hanging off other bullets.
Do not use single bullets.
