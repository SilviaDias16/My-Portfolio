# Style Guide
The rules set out in this Style Guide are designed to bring consistency to an organisation's technical documentation. These rules will help documents to have a common voice and will reduce the number of grammatical and typographical errors, as proper grammar and punctuation will help to maintain credibility.  
The end of this guide contains a short pre-publication checklist that you should refer for a quick check before sending a document out for review or to customers.
## Acronyms and Initialisations
Only use acronyms and initialisations if the term is used twice or more within the document or if the abbreviation is more common that the full name, like USA. Spell out the term, in full, the first time it is used and follow it with its abbreviation in brackets. From then on use the abbreviation.  
If the first appearance is in a title or heading, spell the term in full. Add the abbreviation when it first appears within the body of the document.  
Although acronyms or initialisations are usually in upper case, the full term is not necessarily written in title case.
You only need to spell out an acronym or initialisation if it is helpful to the reader. For example, you would only write “DVD” as it is well known and understood and has only one common meaning.  
Most abbreviations are the same for singular and plural. To make them plural add an “s”, do not use an apostrophe.
>[!NOTE]
>An acronym is pronounced as a word, like ASCII or NATO. An initialisation is not, like CD or BBC.
### EG, IE and Etc
Do not use e.g., i.e. and etc. Replace them with proper text such as: “for example“; “that is“; “such as“; “and so on“.
Abbreviations like these are out of place in technical documentation and are frequently used incorrectly with i.e. and e.g. being confused.
Etcetera is imprecise and lazy: give examples rather than assume the reader knows what you are thinking.
## Ampersands
Do not use “&” as a substitute for “and”, except where it is generally used, such as in a name, like Fortnum & Mason.
## Bullets and Lists
Use lists to chunk related information to make it easier for the reader to scan. Choose the type of list according to the information it contains. Create either an:
* ordered list (using numbers) to present information such as tasks or workflows in the sequence in which they must be read, understood or executed. Ordered lists should also be used if you are writing long sentences or paragraphs, or more than six bullets
* unordered list (bulleted, like this one) to present non-sequential, related information such as a series of options or choices.  

Keep bullets short and to a minimum. Bullets and lists should be preceded by an introductory phrase or sentence ending with a colon.  
If the bullet point is a complete sentence, start with a capital and end with a full stop. If you are just listing items, do not use any punctuation at the end of each bullet except the final one, which needs a full stop.  

Where the bullets continue as part of the introductory sentence, start the bullets with lower case and do not use any punctuation to end them except for the final one, which requires a full stop.  

For example, if the bulleted text is a continuation of the introductory sentence then:
* begin the list using lower case
* do not punctuate the first and middle bullets
* use a full stop at the end of the final bullet.
If possible avoid nested bullets, that is bullets hanging off other bullets.
Do not use single bullets.

## Capitalisation
Use bold and not capitals to emphasise a word or phrase. Do this sparingly.
Colons and hyphens are not followed by a capital letter.
### Departments and Teams
Write department and team names in title case, for example: the Human Resources team.
### Government
Use a capital letter when referring to a specific government, for example, “the Government announced it supported the decision”.
Use a lowercase “g” in adjectival contexts, such as “a government consultation” or “a government decision”.
### Document Titles and Section Headings
Titles of documents and reports should be written in italics and title case. For example, Company Name Style Guide.
Section headings should be written in title case.
The phrase that introduces steps in a procedure should be in sentence case (as well as being in bold and ending with a colon).
### Terms
You should capitalise terms that have a special meaning in a solution, for example the Selections Basket.
## Collective Nouns
Nouns such as “team” and “committee” take a singular verb or pronoun when thought of as a single unit, but a plural verb or pronoun when thought of as a collection of individuals.
For example, “the team visits the head office” but “the team asked questions to address their concerns”.
## Cross-references
References in the text to other sections or to graphics should be cross references so that the text stays in contact with the graphic. Use the Cross-References button on the Insert menu.
Update all fields within a document, cross-references are fields, by pressing Ctrl+A, F9. This also updates the Table of Contents.
## Dates
Write dates as “day month year” (2 May 2017). Do not use abbreviations such as “st”, “nd”, “rd” or “th”.
Do not break a date across two lines. If space is limited, format it as 02/05/17.
## Gender
Do not use “he” or “she” unless you are referring to a specific man or woman. Never use s/he.
Use “you” wherever possible or “they” or “their”. They/their can be used with singular subjects.
Use gender-neutral terms such as people, staff or personnel.
## Graphics
If possible, do not include text in graphics. It makes updating them difficult.
Use numbers to label a picture and follow the graphic with a corresponding table.
Use graphics sparingly and only if they add something to the text.
Graphics should be centred and have a caption. They should also be numbered using the Insert Caption button on the References tab.
Alternatively, use the Graphic Caption Macro button,  . This is located in the Quick Access Toolbar, at the top left-hand side of the MSWord screen.
References to graphics in the text should be cross references so that the text stays in contact with the graphic.
## Italics
Use italics for notes and for the titles of publications. Foreign words and phrases are also italicised unless they have been incorporated into English.
Use bold for emphasis.
## Job Titles
Job titles should be capitalised when referring to a particular individual, for example “Adam Jones, Technical Director, will manage the programme” and “the Team Leader is in charge”.
When speaking about the role in general, however, the job title should be in lower case. For example, “the team will be led by a project manager”.
## May/might (Permission and Probability)
Write “may” to express permission – do not use it in the conditional sense of “might”.
Use “might” to indicate probability.
“A user with the wrong permissions may delete data” is ambiguous because it means that the user is permitted to delete data. What is meant is that the user might delete it.
Write “can” to indicate possibility and capability. For example, “quitting without saving can lose your work”.
## Numbers and Numbering
This section tells you how to treat different kinds of numbers in the documentation.
### Numbers
Numbers from one to ten should be written in full. Figures should be used from 11 upwards.
Exceptions are:
* numbers in addresses
* decimals or fractions
* sums of money
* page numbers
* technical terms, symbols or abbreviations.
  
Abbreviations used with figures should follow immediately with no space, for example, 20mm, 125mps.
Hyphenate fractions when written in full (for example, “two-thirds”). Do not mix decimals and fractions.
Write “24 hours a day” rather than “24/7”.
Do not start a sentence with a numeral, either reorganise the sentence or spell out the number.
Use numerals for percentages and all units of measurement, even those under ten. The exceptions are the following units of time: hours, days, weeks, months, years. Use numerals for minutes and seconds.
### Currency
Use either two digits after the currency symbol, or none if it is a round number. For example, “£1.70” and “£9”.
“Million” and “billion” should be written in full and in lower case, with a space after the numerals (for example,
“£12 million”). In documents that repeatedly mention sums in millions or billions, it is acceptable to abbreviate and omit the space (for example, “£15m” and “£2bn”).
### Large Numbers
Use commas in numbers from 1,000 upwards.
Abbreviate millions to “m” when repeatedly referring to sums of money and when referring to quantities or inanimate objects. For example, “4m transactions each year”.
### Telephone Numbers
Type the area code separately from the main number. For London numbers, this would be “020” the London area code, followed by four digits, then the remaining four digits for example, “020 7983 4000”.
Regional numbers outside of the main cities are written as a five-digit area code, followed by six digits. For example, 01462 474000.
Mobile numbers are also written as five digits, followed by six digits.
For international numbers, always provide full country and local area codes when you include a telephone number. Preface the international code with a plus sign (+) and separate the other elements of the number with spaces and not hyphens. For example:
* UK number: +44 7563 2000
* US number: +1 650 598 4747
## Punctuation
### Exclamation Marks
Do not use these to emphasise text. Only include an exclamation mark at the end of a warning.
### Full Stops
Full stops are not required between initials in names or abbreviations, for example “Mr M Jones”, “HR”, “LSEG”.
Full stops should be followed by a single space, not a double.
### Hyphens
When hyphenated words occur in sets of two or more, hyphenate them like this: “The office was visited by 11- and 12-year old pupils, who were asked to write a 600- to 800-word essay.”  

**Compound Adjectives**  
Compound adjectives (two-worded descriptions) are normally hyphenated, so “twin-track approach“, “20-year agreement“ or “two-worded descriptions“.

**Compound Adverbs**  
Hyphens are not used for adverbs, for example, “genetically modified“.

**Prefixes**  
When adding a prefix, such as “re“, “pre“, “un“, “sub“ and “co“, to a word, it is not necessary to hyphenate.  
Only where a word already exists in the dictionary with the same spelling but different meaning (such as “represent”, “react” or “resent”), or where one “e” is followed by another (such as “re-enter”), should you include a hyphen.

### Quotation Marks
Double quotation marks (or “inverted commas”) are to be used for words that you want to bring to the reader’s attention. Single quotation marks are to be used for quotes.  
For a quote within a quote, use double quotation marks.  
If a quote runs to more than one paragraph, quotation marks should appear at the start of each paragraph but only at the end of the final one.

###  Slash (/)
The slash, also known as the oblique or the diagonal, is used:
1.	to separate alternatives (for example, “and/or“)
2.	to imply “per” in abbreviations (for example,“20mm/year“)
3.	to separate years “2016/17“) and dates “18/08/2017“)

Avoid excessive use of the slash.
Do not put a space before or after a slash.

## Times  
Use the 24-hour clock. For example, 14.05 instead of 2:05pm.

## Underlining
Avoid underlining. An exception would be quoted material which includes underlined text. Use bold for emphasis.

## Pre-Publication Checkist

### Headings
* Check that headings are title case
* Make sure that all sections have at least one sub heading, otherwise ToC looks odd.
* Headings should be followed by appropriate content
* Check the ToC and make sure that no section title is too long
* No heading should follow a heading without text in-between the two
* Check that heading levels are correct
* Check pagination, insert/delete page breaks. No widows/orphans.
* Tables should: have Repeat Heading Row set and rows should not split across pages
* Bullets and numbering (colon, full stops, caps if required, number if required)
* Check that procedure steps are correctly numbered with the correct introduction

### Edits
* Use the present tense. Search for “wills” and, if possible, replace them
* There should be no coloured or highlighted text remaining
* Check for “?” and make sure that they are appropriate
* Make sure that there are no review comments left on the document
* Introduction should be appropriate and contain all necessary information from the document

### Updates
* Update fields, Cross-references, page numbering ToC(s) using Ctrl+A, F9. Do this twice.
* Hyperlinks, check they are correct and that they work

### Diagrams and Screenshots
* Diagrams and screenshots must have numbered captions
* Diagrams must be “Graphic style” followed by “Caption style”
* Screenshots should contain sensible data

### Miscellaneous
* Check that tables have headings and are in the LSE style.
* Check that the copyright year on back page is correct
* Check the version number on the title page
* Check that there are no red, blue or green squiggly underlines added by MSWord
