### Online Knowledge Base

### Tools used: Confluence Wiki, Microsoft Visio, Microsoft Word, Miro and Gliffy

This technical writing project involved creating an online searchable knowledge base for one of my client. I was working on a programme, where my client was in the process of replacing their trading platform with the in-house developed applications, which meant moving away from the existing traditional Software Development Life Cycle approach to new ways of working base on agile and lean practices.

My role was to update the existing knowledge base structure in Confluence to support the new ways of working. I analysed the existing KB, did a gap analysis of what was missing, analysed all the different locations where information was held and the type of content that was needed in the future.

Based on the analysis, I came up with a strategy on how we would start and implement this new structure. Interviewed a number of IT technical stakeholders, understood their needs and created a proposed KB structure layout. This structure layout was done using MS Visio, where different levels within the KB were represented using swim lanes (i.e. level the management would be interested in, level that the technical team would be interested in). 

I enjoyed this opportunity where I got to learn about the approach to Knowledge Management strategy and used my technical writing skills to create a structure that would help the user to find the right information without getting lost in a web of information.
