# FreeCell User Manual
## Introduction
FreeCell is one of the most popular solitaire card games, which is included with Windows. It is played with a regular deck of 52 cards and since all the cards are visible right at the beginning of the game, there is no luck involved. FreeCell is an intelligent game, and you need to plan your strategies well in advance before you start playing this game. Almost every deal can be won if proper strategy is planned and executed correctly.

Let us start by understanding the FreeCell Interface.

</p>

* **Free Cells** - These are dispalyed at the upper-left corner
* **Home Cells** - These are displayed at the upper-right corner
* **Tableau** - Deck of regular 52 cards displayed in eight columns below the Free and Home cells

## Understanding the Aim of the Game
The aim of this game is very straightforward. All you need to do is move all the 52 cards to the Home Cells in such a way that each suite is arranged from highest to the lowest (i.e. starting with Ace and ending with King). Since there are four Home Cells, each suite will be placed in one of the Home Cell as shown in the below image:

## Planning Strategy/Planning the Moves
Remember the aim of the game? You need to move all the 52 cards to the Home Cells. Looking at the cards, you will realise that it is not that simple as it sounds.

**To achieve the aim, you need to plan a strategy:**
1. Evaluate the position of all the cards.
    a. particular card is hidden 
    b. clearly visible, right-click the card to view it clearly
2. Remember, you need to start placing all the Aces in the Home cell. Do not rush to achieve this.
3. You can only access the card at the bottom of all the eight columns .i.e. the card which is fully visible. The other cards in the columns are locked beneath this bottom card.
4. You can move a bottom card from any eight columns to the Free Cells. The Free Cells acts as a placeholder for you cards. You can move cards in and out of the Free Cells.
5. You can also move the bottom card from any eight columns and place it below the bottom card of other columns provided it is in descending order and of different colour than that of the above card as shown below:

6. You can move a card from the Free Cell to the Tableau to release the Free Cell provided:    
i. You have an empty column where you can place the card from the Free Cell.    
ii. You place the card from the Free Cell below the bottom card of any columns as long as it is in descending order and of different colour than that of the bottom card.
3. You can move a card from the Free Cell or a card at the bottom of any eight cells in the Tableau to the Home Cell provided the card belongs to the same suite and is in ascending order as shown below:
